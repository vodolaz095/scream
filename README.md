Scream
======================

[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/vodolaz095/scream.svg)](https://travis-ci.org/vodolaz095/scream)

Application for receiving notifications by POST requests via `curl` and
displaying them via `notification-daemon` service in modern `linux` distros

Requirements
======================

You need to install package `notification-daemon` to be able to start application.
It can be done via your favourite package manager, like `dnf`

```shell

	$ su -c 'dnf install notification-daemon'

```


Usage
======================

Firstly, you need to start application on you desktop PC.

```shell

	$ scream --key=someHardKeyToMakeSpammersSad --listen=0.0.0.0:8082

```

Also you need to open port for this application

```shell

	su -c 'firewall-cmd --permanent --add-port=8082/tcp'

```

On `Fedora 22` with `LXDE` environment, you can autostart your application
by using the startup scripts to start `notification-daemon` and `scream` as the ones
in `contrib/.config/autostart/`. You need to save them to `~/.config/autostart`.

Then, you can send notifications to your desktop from remote\local machine using this, or analogous CURL commands

```shell

    $ curl -X POST -d '{"type":"Notification","message":"Hello!","key":"topSecret"}' http://localhost:8082/

    $ curl -X POST -d type=Notification -d message=Hello! -d key=topSecret  http://localhost:8082/

```
